- eglInitialize (called 1 time) may leak memory (even when eglTerminate is correctly called)
- dnd with chromium-based application under x11 seem to work only on the same monitor
	- bug in chromium (chromium doesnt send events, does not work for other apps as well)
- XGetDefault -> XrmGetFileDatabase one time leak on x11 (?)
