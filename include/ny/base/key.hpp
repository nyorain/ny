//Modeled after linux/input.h

//Note that the keycodes therefore directly match with the linux keycodes defined
//in linux/input.h. They are also similiarly named.
//Keys which names cannot be used as enum name are usually changed a bit.
//If there is no possiblity to change the name (like e.g. for number keys 0-9) they
//have a k (like key) prefix.

//Note that e.g. Keycode::a should never be treated as if the user pressed a keyboard
//button labeled 'A'. The keycodes are only a platform and device independent way of
//representing hardware keys that could be located on a standard us keyboard.
//For keyboards with other character sets (like e.g. japanese or russian keyboards)
//Keycode::a will be generated when the key that is at the location where the 'A' key
//would be on an us keyboard. But that does neither mean that the key that was pressed
//is labeled 'A' nor that the user does now expect to e.g. see an 'A' on screen.
//One should not try to e.g. give keycodes names and represent them to the user
//in any way e.g. as application controls (which seems to make sense first, but
//users may not have any idea how to press the 'W' key for moving forward
//when they have a japanese keyboard).

//Therefore the only use case for Keycodes is when handling special input keys such
//as escape or leftshift that cannot be represented using unicode.
