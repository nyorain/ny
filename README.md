# ny

A lightweight and modern C++17 windowing library.
Tries to only do this one thing; but do it well.
Licensed under the __Boost License__.

**_Under Construction_**

For some first sketchup of how ny will/could look, see the first [docs](doc) or some
really basic [example apps](src/examples).
All kinds of contributions are appreciated.
